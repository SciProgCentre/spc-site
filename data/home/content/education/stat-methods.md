## The purpose

Probability theory and mathematical statistics are an integral part of modern research. Calculation of errors, correct presentation of the result, risk assessment - all these are important components of the work of a scientist. At the same time, as practice shows, many scientists (and not just students) complain about the lack of practical skills in this area. This is due to the fact that the teaching of the theoretical aspect of probability theory is often well-placed in technical universities, but the purely practical aspect is completely overlooked.

In our course, we will try to analyze in detail the issues of the practical application of the statistical methods of in planning and processing the results of a physical experiment (using specific examples). Theoretical calculations will be mainly excluded from lectures and left for independent study.

## Course format

The course is planned in the optional format once a week, while lectures will be held every second week, and practical classes (seminars) will be held between the lectures, discussing examples and solving problems from modern experimental physics and everyday life (including laboratory work) .


Announcements of important events, as well as discussion of any issues related to the course, are available in the Telegram group (https://t.me/mipt_statmethods).

## Reporting

The test takes place in the form of a presentation based on the materials of an individual project. Each student has the opportunity to prepare a report analyzing the results of a particular real or thought experiment (you can take laboratory work).
